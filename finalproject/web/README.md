Data Science Data Visualization

Real-time and historical machine learning from twitter data and visualization:


1) twitter_map.html - Based off Mike Bostock's example choropleth (http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606)
- [X] Add map projections
- [ ] Adjust color map, probably divergent. Or use colorbrewer palettes. 
- [X] Need default color for counties with no tweets 
- [ ] Need way to autorefresh as new data files are created
- [X] Hover text for county FIPS code, name, population, twitter count

2) twitter.tsv - raw count of tweets. Should correlate to population.

3) twitterN.tsv - log of location quotient, scaled to 0-1. Shows exceptions to population trends.

4) twitter_dash.html (TBD) - dashboard containing map, top10, etc.

5) dashboard_sketch.jpg - some ideas on possible dashboard
