Real-time and historical machine learning from twitter data and visualization:


1) twitter_map.html - Based off Mike Bostock's example choropleth (http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606)
- [X] Need to add map projections
- [ ] Adjust color map
- [ ] Need default color for counties with no tweets (grey?)
- [ ] Need way to autorefresh as new data files are created

2) twitter.tsv - raw count of tweets. Should correlate to population.

3) twitterN.tsv - log of location quotient, scaled to 0-1. Shows exceptions to population trends.

4) twitter_dash.html (TBD) - dashboard containing map, top10, etc.
