 *
 * Which US state is home to the highest concentration of coffee snobs?
 *
 * Loads up a week's-worth of tweets from the twitter-gardenhose (https://github.com/mortardata/twitter-gardenhose),
 * searches through them for telltale coffee snob phrases (single origin, la marzocco, etc) and rolls up the 
 * results by US state.
 *
 * NOTE: To switch between datasets of different sizes and conveniently switch between running locally 
 * or on a remote service such as Mortar, use the -f option to reference a file in the params/ directory.
